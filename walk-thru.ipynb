    "This PowerShell script is used to set up and run the `Docker Compose` environment for the Rust proxy server project. It reads environment variables from a `.env` file and exports them before running `Docker Compose` commands.\n",

    "## Script Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filepath**: `{root-workspace-dir}/docker-dev.ps1`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the location of the `.env` file**:\n",
    "   ```powershell\n",
    "   $envFile = \"./.env\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. Check if the `.env` file exists:\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    if (!(Test-Path $envFile)) {\n",
    "        Write-Error \".env file not found!\"\n",
    "        exit 1\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "1. Read each line in the `.env` file (except comments):\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    Get-Content $envFile | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch '^#' -and $_ } | ForEach-Object {\n",
    "        # Split the line into key and value\n",
    "        $key, $value = $_.Split('=', 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Export the variable using Set-Item\n",
    "        Set-Item Env:$key $value\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run Docker Compose commands with exported variables:\n",
    "   ```powershell\n",
    "    docker compose build\n",
    "    docker compose up -d\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    > Note DO NOT use `docker-compose` (note the dash or hyphen) syntax seen in some older blog posts.  The `docker-compose` was a stand alone application and has been deprecated.  It is now embedded as a subcommand within Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this script, run it in a PowerShell terminal:\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "./docker-dev.ps1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- The script checks for the existence of a .env file.\n",
    "- It reads the environment variables from the .env file, ignoring comments.\n",
    "- It exports the environment variables to the current session.\n",
    "- It runs docker compose build to build the Docker images.\n",
    "- It runs docker compose up -d to start the Docker Compose services in detached mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script simplifies the process of setting up and running the Docker Compose environment by automatically exporting the necessary environment variables.\n",
